06/16/2023 Notes from Fisher
1) For flight make sure you tape the SD card in place OR do something to secure it so that it does not "wiggle" out
2) Glue the LED cover on OR take it off if you need to conserve weight
3) On POWER UP
3.1) It takes 41 seconds to get good date and time data
3.2) It takes 258 seconds to get good GPS data
4) Temperature - when directly in the SUN the sensor reads really HOT (e.g., 100 deg F) when the ambient temp is around 70 deg F
5) Version 12 of the flight code, I modified the serial comm baud rate between GPS and Teensy from 39400 to 38400
6) It is recommended we remove GPS from board and switch to I2C communication between GPS and Teensy. This is to get the GPS antenna away from the Teensy I/O pins. 
6.1) This also requires upgrading to version 15 of the flight code
