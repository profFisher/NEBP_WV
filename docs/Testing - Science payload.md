# 18 February launch

Listing down some ideas I had:
 - NEBP provided cut-down system needs to be tested before burst.
	 - We can send multiple commands. in the past we had natural bursts always soon after the command was sent and we are unable to verify if we have that capability 
	 - Accurate ascent rate calculation and measurement 
		 - Evaluate and test new procedures for filling and finding the lift prior to release
		 - better landing predictions (recalculating based on sonde-hub data)

## Science payload - what is it ?

- The main intention is to get fast atmospheric profiles during the eclipse. The payload design contains
	- an APRS for tracking
	- a cut-down system based on 2m radio link 
	- PHat - Pressure,Humidity and temperature measurements saved at high data rates
	- Recovery module for safe landing

## Possible tests

- [ ] DTMF commanding capability with altitude
	- send commands during the balloon ascent and find how the RF/Audio performance of the system.
- [ ] Altitude based cut down. Set a pre defined altitude and see if the developed cut-down system operates as intended
- [ ] Recovery - evaluate the drag coefficients for the current design

## Logistics

- if a separate cut-down is scheduled and executed, we will have a dedicated recovery team. (Including Justin + Hasith + Potentially 2 other undergraduates)
- Need to talk about Go-NoGo for cutdown with Marcus
